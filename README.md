# treeshaking-demo

This is a repo demonstrating how to configure tree-shaking in a `tsup` project.

There are both a `Next.js` application and a `Vite` application to show how different bundlers handle tree-shaking.

To get started, run `npm i` at the root of the project. 

Now you can run `npm run build` and see the results.
